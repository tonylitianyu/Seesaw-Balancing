# Seesaw-Balancing

## Project Description

The task of balancing a seesaw is one form of the ball and beam system, which is a classical problem in control theory. Such a system is naturally unstable and nonlinear, which requires external control force to keep it balanced. There are two ways to perform seesaw balancing: 1) Controlling the seesaw tilting angle to keep the ball at the center. 2) Controlling the ball rolling back and forth to keep the seesaw balanced. Both ways are implemented and demonstrated in this project with the ball being replaced by a sliding block. The external control force is calculated by the feed-forward and feedback PID controller based on the dynamics system modeled by the Euler â€“ Lagrange approach. Also, a disturbance with impact on the seesaw is presented to challenge the control system.
